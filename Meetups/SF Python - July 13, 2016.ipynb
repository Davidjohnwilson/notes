    "\n",
    "Who is the best goaltender? It's tough to separate the goalie from the team effort and we have a small sample of goals. Need to adjust for randomness and information we can identify (offense, number of shots at them, quality of those shots).\n",
    "\n",
    "Can divide into low/medium/high difficulty shots and adjust appropriately. But this isn't enough: there's high correlation between goalies and their backup which suggests that team effects are not totally isolated (or alternatively the teams who find the best starters also find the best backups).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also issue of small sample size. For evaluating playoff performance there is only a maximum of 28 games to get data from. Turns out the worst goalies played the least and the best goalies played the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat this there's a couple of approaches. Bayesian updating of binomail data: take the priors of shots and goals an adjust with saves and shots (effectively consider the goalies that haven't played much as 'average' and the more a goalie plays the less they start as 'average'). Or we can use empirical distribution to establish variance: make up data by taking out blocks of continuous games from the regular season and generate streaks.\n",
